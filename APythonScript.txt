INT. Small conference or meeting room. Day time 

Leslie is in a small room, finishing up the final lines of a programming technical interview. She is 
writing on a white board with a marker, slightly crouched down as she writes a closing bracket on the 
board. She straightens up, and turns to the interviewer, who is also in the room as well. 

				Leslie
		And if after you sort by the keys in the dictionary,
		you should be able to interate it through all of its 
		values, and then return the result. This should run 
		in O(n^2). Which isn't the best, but its better than
		the O(n!) algorithm before.

				Interviewer
		Looks good. You're on the right track. Now do we need
		to store all the values that were given? Is there someway 
		we can reduce the amount of items we need to iterate over?

Leslie pauses for a second while looking at the board. She seems deep in thought, but also a bit rushed
since the time limit to complete the technical interview is running out. 

				Leslie
		Uhh, I don't know. Hmm.

Beat 

				Leslie 
		Oh I got it! We can sort the input first before we stuff 
		it in a hashtable. Then, we can look at the last n/2 input
		and put that in the hashtable instead. It is still O(n^2), 
		but we'll be saving memory. 

Leslie quickly erases some code on the white board and rapidly scribles some code. It looks more 
sloppy compared to the rest of her good handwriting. //She can be seen writing and talking at
the same time. 

				Inteviewer
		Awsome! That looks good. 

Interviewer looks at their phone for time. 

		And we're out of time. But the solution looks good and it was 
		almost exactly what we were looking for. I'll get your results
		to the selction committee and you *should* be hearing from us 
		in the coming days. 


				Leslie
	OK, sounds good. Thank you for your time! 

They shake hands. Leslie leaves the room. 

EXT. Outside a corporate tech office. The suroundings seems modern. 

CUT to Leslie reaching for her phone. She calls her friend, Ron. She walks away from the building as she 
calls Ron on the phone. // 

				Leslie
		Hey Ron, I just got out of the interview? 

				Ron
		Awesome! How did it go? 

		/* enter standard banter here */


CUT TO EXT. Either a coffee shop or a bench near a busy area. They sit down 
/*maybe have ron ask about why Leslie is interviewing before this scene. Or 
have him be surprised that she is interviewing when she already has a job */

				Ron
		So how'd the interview go? 

				Leslie
		It went great! I barely finished in time thought. I was so 
		fucking worried I wouldn't have time to optimize becuase it
		was one of the hardest technical coding interviews I've ever
		been in.

				Ron
		Well it's the last round right? You made it this far. What'd 
		the intervier say?

				Leslie
		She said good job! She gave some pretty strong hints that I got 
		the right answer. So...hopefully I'll be able to pass the interview. 
		And get the job at Billion. 

				Ron
		You basically have it in the bag, if they told you you would get 
		a call back from them. 

Beat. Ron smiles but looks down at his food or coffee. He looks back up with a questioning look.

				Ron 
		So why are you interviewing around? You still working at that 		/*clean this up, bc 
		aweful startup? I thought you enjoyed what you did. Thought that 	  talking 2 companies		
		Leslie wasn't going to work for a heartless tech corporation		  at once is confussing */
		that only sells ads. 								

				Leslie
		Ron, Billion doesn't just sell ads. They also are a huge
		cloudhosting company. That's the team I want to join. 
		And the startup I'm at right now? I don't know. I thought 
		I would love working for a small scrappy team. Everyone 
		giving it all. Where failure could literally be tomorrow 
		or you're hugely succesful tomrrow. 

				Ron
		So what changed? While in college you always talked about working
		at a startup. You and Mark almost dropped out. In fact, you were
		pitching to VCs during senior year. You had a series A going before
		graduation! 

				Leslie
		Yeah, I almost didn't graduate because I was working 
		on our presentation instead of studying for the linear
		algebra final. 

				Ron
		Well what now? Wish you studied for linear algebra now? 


				Leslie
		No, it's that I don't believe in what we're doing any
		more.
