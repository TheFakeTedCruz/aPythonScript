INT. Small conference or meeting room. Day time 

Leslie is in a small room, at a programming technical interview at a large tech company called Billion
simialar to a Google or a Facebook. Leslie is seen finishing up the final lines of a programming technical 
interview. She is writing on a white board with a marker, slightly crouched down as she writes a closing bracket on the board. She straightens up, and turns to the interviewer, who is also in the room as well. 

                Leslie
        And if after you store all the values in a hash table,
        all the IP address should be unique. And its associated 
        value will be a list of timestamps that a user visted 
        the site. And for each visit, we can iterate over each 
        web page for that specific user. This overall process 
        is O(n^2). Which isn't the best, but its better than
        the O(n!) algorithm before.

                Interviewer
        Looks good. You're on the right track. Now do we need
        to store all the values that were given? Is there someway 
        we can reduce the amount of items we need to iterate over?

Leslie pauses for a second while looking at the board. She seems deep in thought, but also a bit rushed
since the time limit to complete the technical interview is running out. 

                Leslie
        Uhh, I don't know. Hmm. (Beat)

                Leslie 
        Oh I got it! We can sort the input first before we stuff 
        it in a hashtable. Then, we can look at the last n/2 input
        and put that in the hashtable instead. It is still O(n^2), 
        but we'll be saving memory. 

Leslie quickly erases some code on the white board and rapidly scribles some code. It looks more 
sloppy compared to the rest of her good handwriting. //She can be seen writing and talking at
the same time. 

                Inteviewer
        Awsome! That looks good. 

Interviewer looks at their phone for time. 

        And we're out of time. But the solution looks good and it was 
        almost exactly what we were looking for. I'll get your results
        to the selction committee and you *should* be hearing from us 
        in the coming days. 


                Leslie
        OK, sounds good. Thank you for your time! 

They shake hands. Leslie leaves the room. 

EXT. Outside a corporate tech office. The suroundings seems modern. 

CUT to Leslie reaching for her phone. She calls her friend, Ron. She walks away from the building as she 
calls Ron on the phone. // 

                Leslie
        Hey Ron, I just got out. You good for lunch in 10 minutes?

                Ron
        Yeah sure. Sounds good. I'll be done with our load test
        soon. Meet you at lunch in 10. 

Leslie hangs up her phone and gets in her car and she drives off. 


CUT TO EXT. Either a coffee shop or a bench near a busy area. Ron is sitting at
a table awating for Leslie. She walks in and looks for her friend. Ron looks up 
and waves to her. Leslie notices and sits at his table. 

/*  maybe have ron ask about why Leslie is interviewing before this scene. Or 
    have him be surprised that she is interviewing when she already has a job.
    This scene is a fork in that it can decide the tone of this film and the 
    mentality of Leslie. 
*/

                Ron
        Sup Leslie, long time no see. How've you been? Been a long 
        time since graduation.  

                Leslie
        Yeah it has! It's been...stressful, being the CTO 
        at Aireal The startup life is a wild rollercoaster.
        Everyday shit's breaking. And you and a small 
        ragtag team of software engineers are in the trenches
        trying to fix it. And how have you been? 

                Ron
         I am a lead developer for my team now. Get to make the 
         big decisions such as: are we using tabs or spaces
         as our for our code base. 

                Leslie
        Congrats on your promotion into upper management. 

                Ron 
        I'm not there yet. I still code everyday. And you
        need to stop needlessly hating on "upper management".

Leslie smiles at the small jab at her distrustful sentiment. She seems like she is looking for the courage 
to say something. She finally looks at Ron 

                Leslie
        I just interviewed at Billion today. 

                Ron
        (Surprised) Seriously? Well why-how was he interview?


                Leslie
        The interview went great. She said good I did a good
        job finding the most efficient solution and gave some
        pretty strong hints that I got the right answer. She 
        even said that I should hear from Billion's recruiting
        team next week. So...hopefully I'll be able to move on 
        to the next round. 

                Ron
        (Still incredulous) Okay, so you basically have it in
        the bag then, if they told you you would get a call back
        from them. 
        
Ron smiles but looks down at his food or coffee. He looks back up with a questioning look.

                Ron 
        So why are you interviewing at Billion? I thought you 
        were loving that startup life? Thought that Leslie wasn't 
        going to work for a huge, heartless tech corporation
        that only sells ads.                                

                Leslie
        You know, I thought the same thing too. But now, I'm 
        not so sure. I think I need to see something else to 
        truely know if I really want...this. I enjoy working 
        in a small scrappy team. Everyone giving their all.
        Where failure could literally be tomorrow or success
        could be a year away. But...

                Ron
        But... 

Leslie looks distraught and unsure of herself. 
        
                Ron
        Here's some unqualified advice. While in college you
        always talked about working at a startup. You and
        Mark almost dropped out. In fact, you were pitching 
        to VCs during senior year. You had a series A going 
        before graduation! 

                Leslie
        Yeah, I almost didn't graduate because I was working 
        on our presentation instead of studying for the linear
        algebra final. 

                Ron
        And now what, Aireal is on the news for a 100 million
        dollar valuation? You definitely contributed to that 
        valuation and the growth of Aireal. You've always had 
        this rebel-entreprenuer inside you.

                Leslie
        Yeah but, I knew working at Aireal is going to hard.
        Long hours, scrappy environment, and fighting for 
        funding. But it's one thing to know about it, it's 
        another to experience it. I think I just had this
        over-romanticized perception of a startup. 

                Ron
        You might have had this rosey-view of working at a 
        startup, but that's fine. You've done well so far. 
        Looking from the outside, you are a very capable CTO. 
        You hitting a difficult patch right now? 

                Leslie
        Yeah. Going through a series C, focusing on growth, 
        somehow we're supposed to double our paying users 
        in the next two quarters. All while making sure the 
        servers don't crumble under more users and developing
        new features for the site!

                Leslie
        No, it's that I don't believe in what we're doing any
        more. The VC culture, only focusing on growth. We've 
        lost track of who we are, who we were. 

Ron's phone rings or buzzes. Ron looks at his phone and looks a little shook.

                Ron
        Well that's a shame. We should talk about this later. 
        I gotta go. Production issues. Someone didn't config
        the load balancer correctly. 

They both get up and leave. Leslie and Ron exit the coffee shop in seperate directions. As Leslie 
leaves, she looks disheartend. She looks at the ground as she walks away.  

CUT TO an office building with a modern, open office setup. Computers and laptops line the tables.
There are a bunch of wires and coffee cups that are on the tables. The atmosphere gives off a tech
and startup feel. People are working at their computers either at the tables or on couches. Leslie 
walks in and starts to head for her desk. She gets interrupted by Mark, her co-founder and CEO. 

                Mark
        Hey! How's my beautiful CTO doing this fine afternoon? 

Leslie feigns a smile to hide her discomfort. 

                Leslie
        I'm good. Gonna meet with the backend engineers to 
        finalize our authentication platform and then meet with
        the frontend engineers to plan for our new web page
        for the upcoming feature. 

                Mark
        Awsome. That sounds great. And I know you are working 
        really hard, but we need to add one new feature. 

                Leslie
        Another one?! Really? My team is already pulling
        12 hour days just to keep the current web services
        afloat. There are so many critical functions, like 
        the ads generator, that could literally go down if 
        someone opened their browser console. Our servers
        for storing user's video, the main thing that attracts
        users to our app, are barely scaling to demand. And
        now you come to me with another requirement? You 
        gotta stop changing our requirements when we're in 
        the middle of an iteration! 

                Mark
        I get that you guys are working hard but, look.
        I already told the investors we are going to add
        this new part in our next release. If we want to 
        get our next round of funding, we need to add 
        this new feature that I came up with in the next
        release. Otherwise, we're out of money. 

Leslie pauses to think about the overload that her and her team is facing with these new requirements
for the startup's core application. She looks shocked and in dispair. 

                Leslie 
        (reluctently) Okay. What do you got? 

                Mark
        We need to add a distributed ledger.

                Leslie
        (beat). A fucking blockchain? 

                Mark
        Yeah. Our VCs want us to use blockchain. They
        increased their funding by 5% because I told
        them we would use blockchain. Oh and machine
        learning. They were super psyched! 

                Leslie
        Are you ser-
Mark's phone rings and he picks it up. He walks away from Leslie without saying goodbye. He can be heard talking in a bro-frat-style voice to the investor on the phone. 

                Mark
        (As he's leaving) Sup Bro?...We'll definitely 
        get the new blockchain thingy out in the next
        release. Don't you worry, man. 

Leslie stands there incredulously.

                Leslie
        What the fuck? Fuck our investors. 

Leslie walks to her table with other people working at the same table. She sits down. Another 
software developer at the desk turns and talks to her. She begins working .

CUT TO a conference room with a white board in the same building. It is clearly later than before she
first came in, perhaps even at night. 

/* This scene could come right after Leslie goes to her desk. She could meet up with her dev team 
    and break the news, when it's still in the afternoon*/ 
                
                Leslie
        Alright. So we need to start work migrating our current
        shit database to a faster one like Postgres. And we 
        also need to clean up the user interface so that
        the ads have more space. That's what our investors
        want for this new release. 
                (beat)
        And we also need to implement a blockchain. 

The engineers in the room have questioned looks and start talking among themsselves. 

                Leslie
        Guys. I know its just a hyped up tech that no one knows
        anything about right now, but Mark told me that the 
        investors want us to use a blockchain in order to get
        our series C. 

                Engineer 1 (Kelly)
        Are you serious? We've spent 12 hours here for the past
        2 weeks trying to get our new version for ad placement
        to work. We barely have time to finish scaling our video
        service too. 

                Engineer 2 (Jason)
        I agree. The frontend UI has changed so much, just in 
        the past 3 days. The frontend designers can't keep 
        up with the the new features that we're supposed to 
        have AND keep up with the new specs for any previous 
        work we did. 

                Engineer 1
        Leslie, you've done a good job shielding us from meetings
        and management BS so we could do our jobs developing the 
        app. But you gotta tell Mark that he can't keep bombarding 
        us with new features every other day just because it sounds 
        cool. 

                Engineer 2
        Yeah. We have no time. 

Leslie stands there in thought, trying to figure out how to solve her teams tech problems. After pondering for a few seconds she raises her head. 

                Leslie
        Kelly, migrate our user info tables to the new database
        only. Our test data can wait. Jason, try to hardcode 
        some of the front end componants right now. For the video
        service problems, we won't serve 1080p video, just 720. 

                Engineer 1
        And the blockchain thing?

                Leslie
        Uhh, I don't know. Just make a linked list in random
        folder that doens't get used. We can call it "a fast
        and lightweight blockchain."

                Engineer 1 
        Sounds good.

Everyone leaves the conference room. Leslie stays back while looking at her notebook and her laptop. She is 
typing a few things on her computer. 

CUT to the same room. It is 1:00am on her computer clock. She looks noticibibly more tired than before. Two 
coffee cups sit at her table in the conference room. Her phone buzzes. It is Ann, her mentor. Leslie picks up 
her cell phone. 


                Leslie
        Hey Ann, why are you calling me so late? And more 
        importantly, why are you calling me? We're millennials;
        we don't call. 

                Ann
        Yean, well miss me with that bullshit. How's work? 
        Are you Steve Jobs yet? Or are you gonna end up
        like Theranos?

                Leslie
        Only time will tell. And if we hve more time.
        So we might never know. 

                Ann
        You'll figure it out. You always do. I've been watching
        over you since your freshman year and I don't think 
        I've seen a smarter and motivated person. 

                Leslie
        Thanks. It means a lot. I've been so lucky to have 
        a great mentor by my side, helping me navigate through
        shitstorm after shitstorm. 

                Ann
        Well it sounds like you're having fun at the startup
        life. 

                Leslie
        Yeah. But there's a big comfort knowing that its my own
        shitstorm. And not some fuckboy-CEO's problem who is 
        20 levels separated from you in management and pushes
        the grunt work to the engineers and blames them 
        for not delivering on their code. When its the fuckboy
        CEO who keeps fucking changing what they want and it 
        gets annoying for the engineering team. 

                Ann
        Wow. That's a lot coming from you. You sure that isn't 
        your CEO? Your co-founder? 

                Leslie
        It is a little bit. But we all have our faults. And he's 
        not that bad anyway. 

                Ann
        And why do you always hate on upper management? 

                Leslie
        Oh sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. Congratz on your
        promotion. 

                Ann
        Thank you! It's nice at upper management. I get to tell
        the software developers what to do now. Guide the architecture
        decisions. You should try it. 
        (beat)
        How was your interview today? At Billion?

                Leslie
        It was good! Got through the problem with just barely 
        enough time left. But the recruiter said some pretty
        positive things as I left. 

                Ann
        So after all this talk about startup startup startup,
        you want to work for Billion? One of the Big 4 tech
        companies?

                Leslie
        They still have a startup feel. And I don't know. I 
        enjoy taking charge of my startup's problems because
        they're my problems. And even though I might enjoy
        the atmosphere at Billion, and the people, I don't
        think I'll ever be able to get over my entreprenurial
        spirit. You know what I mean? 

                Ann
        Yeah I get it. Good for you though. Anyways. get
        some sleep. Your company will die when you're 
        sleep deprived. 

                Leslie
        (jokingly annoyed) 
        Fine, I will.  And thanks for calling. Means a lot. 

                Ann
        Of course. Anytime. See ya. 

                Leslie
        See ya. 

Leslie hangs up the phone and stares at her computer, still unmoving since she hung up the phone. She has a slight smile.
                
                Leslie
        Yeah. My company.           

FADE OUT.
