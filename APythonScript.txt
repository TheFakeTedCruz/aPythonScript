INT. Small conference or meeting room. Day time 

Leslie is in a small room, finishing up the final lines of a programming technical interview. She is 
writing on a white board with a marker, slightly crouched down as she writes a closing bracket on the 
board. She straightens up, and turns to the interviewer, who is also in the room as well. 

                Leslie
        And if after you sort by the keys in the dictionary,
        you should be able to interate it through all of its 
        values, and then return the result. This should run 
        in O(n^2). Which isn't the best, but its better than
        the O(n!) algorithm before.

                Interviewer
        Looks good. You're on the right track. Now do we need
        to store all the values that were given? Is there someway 
        we can reduce the amount of items we need to iterate over?

Leslie pauses for a second while looking at the board. She seems deep in thought, but also a bit rushed
since the time limit to complete the technical interview is running out. 

                Leslie
        Uhh, I don't know. Hmm.

Beat 

                Leslie 
        Oh I got it! We can sort the input first before we stuff 
        it in a hashtable. Then, we can look at the last n/2 input
        and put that in the hashtable instead. It is still O(n^2), 
        but we'll be saving memory. 

Leslie quickly erases some code on the white board and rapidly scribles some code. It looks more 
sloppy compared to the rest of her good handwriting. //She can be seen writing and talking at
the same time. 

                Inteviewer
        Awsome! That looks good. 

Interviewer looks at their phone for time. 

        And we're out of time. But the solution looks good and it was 
        almost exactly what we were looking for. I'll get your results
        to the selction committee and you *should* be hearing from us 
        in the coming days. 


                Leslie
    OK, sounds good. Thank you for your time! 

They shake hands. Leslie leaves the room. 

EXT. Outside a corporate tech office. The suroundings seems modern. 

CUT to Leslie reaching for her phone. She calls her friend, Ron. She walks away from the building as she 
calls Ron on the phone. // 

                Leslie
        Hey Ron, I just got out of the interview? 

                Ron
        Awesome! How did it go? 

        /* enter standard banter here */


CUT TO EXT. Either a coffee shop or a bench near a busy area. They sit down 
/*maybe have ron ask about why Leslie is interviewing before this scene. Or 
have him be surprised that she is interviewing when she already has a job */

                Ron
        So how'd the interview go? 

                Leslie
        It went great! I barely finished in time thought. I was so 
        fucking worried I wouldn't have time to optimize becuase it
        was one of the hardest technical coding interviews I've ever
        been in.

                Ron
        Well it's the last round right? You made it this far. What'd 
        the intervier say?

                Leslie
        She said good job! She gave some pretty strong hints that I got 
        the right answer. So...hopefully I'll be able to pass the interview. 
        And get the job at Billion. 

                Ron
        You basically have it in the bag, if they told you you would get 
        a call back from them. 

Beat. Ron smiles but looks down at his food or coffee. He looks back up with a questioning look.

                Ron 
        So why are you interviewing around? You still working at that       /*clean this up, bc 
        aweful startup? I thought you enjoyed what you did. Thought that      talking 2 companies       
        Leslie wasn't going to work for a heartless tech corporation          at once is confussing */
        that only sells ads.                                

                Leslie
        Ron, Billion doesn't just sell ads. They also are a huge
        cloudhosting company. That's the team I want to join. 
        And the startup I'm at right now? I don't know. I thought 
        I would love working for a small scrappy team. Everyone 
        giving it all. Where failure could literally be tomorrow 
        or you're hugely succesful tomrrow. 

                Ron
        So what changed? While in college you always talked about working
        at a startup. You and Mark almost dropped out. In fact, you were
        pitching to VCs during senior year. You had a series A going before
        graduation! 

                Leslie
        Yeah, I almost didn't graduate because I was working 
        on our presentation instead of studying for the linear
        algebra final. 

                Ron
        Well what now? Wish you studied for linear algebra now? 


                Leslie
        No, it's that I don't believe in what we're doing any
        more. The VC culture, only focusing on growth. We've 
        lost track of who we are, who we were. 

Ron's phone rings or buzzes. Ron looks at his phone and looks a little shook.

                Ron
        Well that's a shame. We should talk about this later. 
        I gotta go. Production issues. Someone didn't config
        the load balencer correctly. 

They both get up and leave. Leslie and Ron exit the coffee shop in seperate directions. As Leslie 
leaves, she looks disheartend. She looks at the ground as she walks away.  

CUT TO an office building with a modern, open office setup. Computers and laptops line the tables.
There are a bunch of wires and coffee cups that are on the tables. The atmosphere gives off a tech
and startup feel. People are working at their computers either at the tables or on couches. Leslie 
walks in and starts to head for her desk. She gets interrupted by Mark, her co-founder and CEO. 

                Mark
        Hey! How's my beautiful CTO doing this fine afternoon? 

Leslie feigns a smile to hide her discomfort. 

                Leslie
        I'm good. Gonna meet with the backend engineers to 
        finalize our authentication platform and then meet with
        the frontend engineers to plan for our new web page
        for the upcoming feature. 

                Mark
        Awsome. That sounds great. And I know you are working 
        really hard, but we need to add one new feature. 

                Leslie
        Another one?! Really? My team is already pulling
        12 hour days just to keep the current web services
        afloat. There are so many critical functions, like 
        the ads generator, that could literally go down if 
        someone opened their browser console. Our servers
        for storing user's video, the main thing that attracts
        users to our app, are barely scaling to demand. And
        now you come to me with another requirement? You 
        gotta stop changing our requirements when we're in 
        the middle of an interation! 

                Mark
        I get that you guys are working hard but, look.
        I already told the investors we are going to add
        this new part in our next release. If we want to 
        get our next round of funding, we need to add 
        this new feature that I came up with in the next
        release. Otherwise, we're out of money. 

Leslie pauses to think about the overload that her and her team is facing with these new requirements
for the startup's core application. She looks shocked and in dispair. 

                Leslie 
        (reluctently) Okay. What do you got? 

                Mark
        We need to add a distributed ledger.

                Leslie
        A fucking blockchain? 

                Mark
        Yeah. Our VCs want us to use blockchain. They
        increased their funding by 5% because I told
        them we would use blockchain. Oh and machine
        learning. They were super psyched! 

                Leslie
        Are you ser-
Mark's phone rings and he picks it up. He walks away from Leslie without saying goodbye. He can
be heard talking in a bro-frat-style voice to the investor on the phone. 

                Mark
        (As he's leaving) Sup Bro?...We'll definitely 
        get the new blockchain thingy out in the next
        release. Don't you worry, man. 

Leslie stands there incredulously.

                Leslie
        What the fuck? Fuck our investors. 

Leslie walks to her table with other people working at the same table. She sits down. Another 
software developer at the desk turns and talks to her. She begins working .

CUT TO a conference room with a white board in the same building. It is clearly later than before she
first came in, perhaps even at night. 

/* This scene could come right after Leslie goes to her desk. She could meet up with her dev team 
    and break the news, when it's still in the afternoon*/ 
                
                Leslie
        Alright. So we need to start work migrating our current
        shit database to a faster one like Postgres. And we 
        also need to clean up the user interface so that
        the ads have more space. That's what our investors
        want for this new release. 
                (beat)
        And we also need to implement a blockchain. 

The engineers in the room have questioned looks and start talking among themsselves. 

                Leslie
        Guys. I know its just a hyped up tech that no one knows
        anything about right now, but Mark told me that the 
        investors want us to use a blockchain in order to get
        our series C. 

                Engineer 1 (Kelly)
        Are you serious? We've spent 12 hours here for the past
        2 weeks trying to get our new version for ad placement
        to work. We barely have time to finish scaling our vido
        service too. 

                Engineer 2 (Jason)
        I agree. The frontend UI has changed so much, just in 
        the past 3 days. The frontend designers can't make 
        keep up with the new for the new features that we're 
        supposed to have AND keep up with the new specs for 
        any previous work we did. 

                Engineer 1
        Leslie, you've done a good job shielding us from meetings
        so we could do our jobs developing the app. But you 
        gotta tell Mark that he can't keep bombarding us with 
        new features every other day just because it sounds cool. 

                Engineer 2
        Yeah. We have no time. 

                Leslie
        Kelly, migrate our user info tables to the new database
        only. Our test info can wait. Jason, try to hardcode 
        some of the Angular componants right now. For the video
        service problems, we won't serve 1080p video, just 720. 

                Engineer 1
        And the blockchain thing?

                Leslie
        Uhh, I don't know. Just make a linked list in random
        folder that doens't get used. We can call it "a fast
        and lightweight blockchain."

                Engineer 1 
        Sounds good.

Everyone leaves the conference room.
