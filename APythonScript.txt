INT. Small conference or meeting room. Day time 

Leslie is in a small room, finishing up the final lines of a programming technical interview. She is 
writing on a white board with a marker, slightly crouched down as she writes a closing bracket on the 
board. She straightens up, and turns to the interviewer, who is also in the room as well.

		And if after you sort by the keys in the dictionary,
		you should be able to interate it through all of its 
		values, and then return the result. This should run 
		in O(n^2). Which isn't the best, but its better than
		the O(n!) algorithm before.

				Interviewer
		Looks good. You're on the right track. Now do we need
		to store all the values that were given? Is there someway 
		we can reduce the amount of items we need to iterate over?

Leslie pauses for a second while looking at the board. She seems deep in thought, but also a bit rushed
since the time limit to complete the technical interview is running out. 

				Leslie
		Uhh, I don't know. Hmm.

		Oh I got it! We can sort the input first before we stuff 
		it in a hashtable. Then, we can look at the last n/2 input
		and put that in the hashtable instead. It is still O(n^2), 
		but we'll be saving memory. 

Leslie quickly erases some code on the white board and rapidly scribles some code. It looks more 
sloppy compared to the rest of her good handwriting. //She can be seen writing and talking at
the same time. 

				Inteviewer
		Awsome! That looks good. 

Interviewer looks at their phone for time. 

		And we're out of time. But the solution looks good and it was 
		almost exactly what we were looking for. I'll get your results
		to the selction committee and you *should* be hearing from us 
		in the coming days. 


				Leslie
	OK, sounds good. Thank you for your time!
